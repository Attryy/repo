Use the same date format. I would suggest copying and pasting the End time and just editing the time (or day if you went through midnight in a work session).\n\nHave one entry per work session.\n\nPut this log in log.txt.\n\nInstructions\n------------\n- Create a new repository called cs290-assignment3 at the location you specified in week 1.\n- Clone this repository and copy all of the contents to that repository\n  - The directory structure should look like this:\n    - cs290-assignment3\n      - log.txt\n      - qunit_runner.html\n      - qunit\n      - src\n      - tests\n- **You are only allowed to modify the files in the src directory.**\n  - There are some additional files, those are just a hook for us to eventually support a better testing system.\n  - The comments in the files in the src directory describe the intended behavior of the functions that you need to fill in. Please ask on the discussion boards if you are confused about the intended functionality of any function.\n  - Within those files, your code should go between the `//your code here` comments.\n  - You should replace `return undefined;` with appropriate return statements.\n- Add **cs290osu** as a collaborator. This will be an account that myself and the TAs share to access your repos.\n- To test your code open the `qunit_runner.html` web page locally. Along with the red errors check for statements saying something like `Expected 4 assertions, but 2 were run`. This means that the test had to abort early due to a error it could not recover from. That means there are two additional tests that are not even getting run.\n  - Given the nature of automated tests, it is easy to see what the expected values are and simply hard code those returns. If you do this for any portion of the assignment, you will get a 0 for the whole assignment. (For example, variableModification should work for any value, not just 42, but we are only testing the value 42. If you hardcode the values `47`, `'42'` and `'42foo'` that is a violation of this rule. )\n","isFork":null},{"name":"donneler.github.io","url":"https://github.com/ekrengel/donneler.github.io","description":null,"lang":["HTML","CSS","JavaScript"],"readme":null,"isFork":null},{"name":"cs290-assignment3p2","url":"https://github.com/ekrengel/cs290-assignment3p2","description":"Assignment 3 Part 2: Adding AJAX and HTML","lang":["JavaScript","HTML"],"readme":null,"isFork":null},{"name":"cs290-assignment2","url":"https://github.com/ekrengel/cs290-assignment2","description":"HTML and CSS","lang":["HTML","CSS"],"readme":null,"isFork":null},{"name":"CS161","url":"https://github.com/ekrengel/CS161","description":"Intro to Programming in C++","lang":["C++"],"readme":"CS161\n=====\n\nIntro to Programming in C++\n","isFork":null}]}
